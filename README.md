## Jukebox

## Goal - Demonstrate understanding of objects in JavaScript by building a music player that will end up playing any mp3 you can find 				online.

## To Do:
	1. Display at least one song on the page when the page loads
	2. Give the user the ability to play that song, without using the "built-in" play button. 
	3. Give the user the ability to stop that song without using the "built-in" stop button. 
	4. Give the user the ability to load at least one different song into the Jukebox besides the one that is loaded when the page 	
		initially renders
	5. The whole Jukebox should be backed by an object called Jukebox with methods to play, stop, and load songs.
